# Remix Deno JIT

This is an experimental interface for running a Remix application on Deno without a build step. This means a just-in-time (JIT) compilation of the application if / when client assets are requested.

## Inspiration

This experiment was inspired by Ryan Dahl's talk at Remix Conf and the subsequent Deno Fresh project that came after.
